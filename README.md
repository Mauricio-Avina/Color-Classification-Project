# Color Classification Project
## Overview
This project focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to identify nine different colors present in images. The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying colors from a diverse range of input images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains images with various objects and scenes, each labeled with one of nine color categories. The dataset was curated and labeled specifically for this project to ensure a comprehensive representation of the target colors.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing:
The images were preprocessed to standardize dimensions, normalize pixel values, and enhance color clarity.
Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments were applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
### Model Architecture:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed for feature extraction and color classification.
Different architectures, including custom-designed ones and popular ones like VGG, ResNet, and Inception, were experimented with to find the most effective model.
## Training:
The models were trained on a subset of the dataset and validated on a separate subset to monitor for overfitting.
Transfer learning was utilized by fine-tuning pre-trained models to leverage features learned from large-scale datasets like ImageNet.
## Evaluation:
The performance of the trained models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.
Test images with known color labels were used to assess the model's ability to correctly classify colors.
